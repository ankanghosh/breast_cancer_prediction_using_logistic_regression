# breast_cancer_prediction_using_logistic_regression
Classification and prediction of breast cancer (benign / malignant) using a dataset from Kaggle and logistic regression.

# About the project
Classification and prediction of breast cancer (benign / malignant) using a dataset from Kaggle and logistic regression.
This is a Google Colab notebook to predict breast cancer using a Kaggle dataset. The data is first cleaned and normlized. PCA is used to aid in dimensionality reduction and feature engineering. A single-layer neural network is used to implement the logistic regression model for binary classification. The model performs fairly well and achieves an accuracy of about 99%.

# Tools Used
Tools and libraries used in this project include TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and seaborn.

# Who can benefit from the project?
Anyone can use the project to get started with the basics of binary classification and TensorFlow.

# Getting Started
Anyone interested in getting started with Machine Learning or Deep Learning, specifically, binary classification tasks using TensorFlow and logistic regression, can clone or download the project to get started.

# References
I have leveraged ChatGPT for guidance in terms of some concepts and to clarify doubts, both theoretical and code-based. However, I did not use ChatGPT to generate code. One may find [this](https://saturncloud.io/blog/multiclass-logistic-regression-with-tensorflow-20-a-comprehensive-guide/#3) article about multi-class classification useful for getting started.

# Additional Notes
1. The dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data/data). If the dataset is taken down in the future, please feel free to reach out to me at ankanatwork@gmail.com if you would like to learn more about the data. However, I may not be able to share the dataset with you due to licensing restrictions.
2. The project is a basic one in nature and is not currently being maintained.
